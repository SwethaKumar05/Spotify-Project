# Spotify-Project
The aim to explores data manipulation, aggregation, and visualization techniques using Python’s Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. 

📌 Data Cleaning and Preparation
✔ Handling missing values in key columns.
✔ Standardizing and transforming categorical features (e.g., mode, release_day_name).
✔ Creating new derived features, such as decade classification and energy levels.

📌 Feature Engineering & Data Transformation
✔ Extracting release trends from date-based columns.
✔ Categorizing song durations and popularity levels dynamically.
✔ Applying lambda functions, apply(), map(), and filter() for efficient data transformations.
✔ Using groupby() and aggregation functions to analyze trends in song streams.
✔ Ranking artists based on total streams using rank().

📌 Data Aggregation and Trend Analysis
✔ Identifying the most common musical keys used in songs.
✔ Tracking song releases over time with rolling averages.
✔ Comparing Major vs. Minor key distributions in song compositions.

📌 Data Visualization
✔ Bar plots for ranking top artists and stream counts.
✔ Box plots to analyze stream distribution per release year.
✔ Heatmaps to examine feature correlations.
✔ Pie charts to understand song popularity distribution.

📌 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of Spotify streaming statistics and includes features such as:

🎵 track_name – Song title.
🎤 artist(s)name – Name(s) of performing artists. 🔢 streams – Number of times the song was streamed. 📅 released_year, released_month, released_day – Date of song release. 🎼 energy%, danceability_%, valence_% – Audio feature metrics.
📊 in_spotify_playlists – Number of Spotify playlists featuring the song.
🎹 mode – Musical mode (Major or Minor).
🎯 Purpose
This analysis is designed for:
✔ Exploring real-world datasets to develop data analyst skills.
✔ Practicing data transformation, aggregation, and visualization techniques.
✔ Preparing for data analyst interviews by working with structured workflows.
